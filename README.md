# Bootstrap Portfolio Challenge


## Description 

This project is the third challenge of the 2023-24 edX Front-End Development Bootcamp.
This challenge is a Bootstrap-based version of a portfolio site showing to showcase skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. 

After learning about Grid, Flexbox, and Bootstrap, I decided that I would use Botstrap for future projects, for both harnessing the resources available and modifying code to reach the best possible outcome. Whilst the process of figuring out the way overriding the prebuilt classes and properties seems overwelhming, is exciting in the same time when the goal is to built something more visually appealing.

## Development
**HTML**

As I think about projects as in one hand a path to master how to work with Bootstrap and on the other hand a future professional portfolio site already, I started as like most will do: I looked for a starting point and found an example template on the official Bootstrap site. The template is "Cover" and it's made by 
 <a href="https://twitter.com/mdo">@mdo</a>.

Below is the current state of the site, after some rework.

**Nav**

The site now has a centered navigation bar, which has achieved by removing the 'h3' tag which served as the logo, and changing the alignment to 'justify-content-center' with making sure the parent class has a 'd-flex' class to ensure it functions correctly.

```
<div class="cover-container d-flex w-100 h-100 p-3 mx-auto flex-column">
```



**Fonts**

Fonts used throughtout the site are now 'Sacramento', Poppins, and 'Hachi Maru Pop'.
